# Character-Recognition-System
Character recognition system is being implemented in Python using Neural Networks. The objective of this project is to feed the network with some character image and it will predict the character with certainity.

## Image-Classification-by-Keras-and-Tensorflow
Image Classification using Keras as well as Tensorflow. Image Classification is a Machine Learning module that trains itself from an existing dataset of multiclass images and develops a model for future prediction of similar images not encountered during training. Developed using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

## CNN's
A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a specific type of artificial neural network that uses perceptrons, a machine learning unit algorithm, for supervised learning, to analyze data. CNNs apply to image processing, natural language processing and other kinds of cognitive tasks.
A convolutional neural network is also known as a ConvNet.

## Walkthrough the Files:
1. Data Prepration for CNN (pickling):
   -In this code, we prepare a single data file of all the images combined which can be directly fed to our CNN.The labels are stored in a 
    separate file nameed "Labels.pickle" which contain the corresponding label/class to the images.
2. CNN Model:
   -In this file , we train our model with data, and validate the model with data-file which we created.
3. Prediction:
   -This file predicts our models prediction. We input the image path in the function which is made in the respective file, and boom it 
    it gives the output.
